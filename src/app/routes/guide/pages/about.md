This is the first in a *series of discussions* about chasing, meant to be accessible to people completely new to chasing. 
Because chasing is anchored in the physical, real world examples will be used whenever possible. For today's reading, 
we'll be using the May 24th 2011 tornado outbreak for examples.

There can be no place to start a discussion on chasing besides understanding what professional meteorologists see in 
any given situation; their expertise, education, and experience gives them an edge over all but the best storm chasers 
in understanding the synoptic set up. When it comes to severe convection the most widely used website, and the most 
important to understand, is the **Storm Prediction Center**, or the SPC. They employ the premier scientists that deal with 
severe weather, and their entire job is to monitor the United States for severe weather setups, and issue forecasts 
in the form of **convective outlooks**, **mesoscale discussions**, and **watches**.

Let's take a brief look at their website. You can access it at spc.noaa.gov, and you should memorize or bookmark this 
address - you're going to use it a lot. For now just click around and become 
familiar with the interface. Let's familiarize ourselves with the three main products of the SPC using a simple case study.

Well start with the product with which you are most likely familiar: **watches**. The SPC is the only entity which 
issues severe weather watches in the US. For our purposes, we are only concerned with severe thunderstorm 
and tornado watches. A watch is issued in advance of severe convection, when atmospheric conditions 
are most conducive to severe weather. In general, they are issued after convective initiation is visible on satellite 
imagery, and also generally after a mesoscale discussion (discussed later in this post).

You'll see the radar when the watch was issued, with the included counties outlined. A short rationale for the watch 
is provided below it. Right now, that looks jargon filled and imposing, especially because it is in all caps. 
Future posts will explain the mass of what is being said in that text, and help you to capitalize on that information 
in the field.

One important thing to recognize in this watch is that it is a **particularly dangerous situation** or PDS watch. 
These are relatively rare, and indicate situations which are particularly prone to produce violent, long track 
tornadoes, or (more rarely) significant severe winds associated with a derecho. You can learn more about PDS watches here.
Finally, you will notice that there are probabilities for each of the severe criteria listed happening within the 
watch's bounds -- these probabilities give you a quick judgement of how the SPC sees the situation playing out.

With that in mind, let's take a look at a typical **mesoscale discussion**: mesoscale discussions, like watches, are 
issued by the SPC on the day of the severe convection. They are a short analysis of an area likely to see severe 
weather develop, or of an ongoing event. They cover an area larger than a single storm cell, and are generally more 
meteorologically intensive than most discussions. They also tend to proceed a watch by 1 to 3 hours, and generally 
discuss the likelihood of issuing or continuing a watch.

You can see what an MD looks like. Again, you see a block of all caps text. That is the most important part, 
and it is likely more or less jargon to you now. The hope of this series is to help make that information 
usable to you to chase more safely and productively. For now, know MDs exist. As you get ready to chase, 
these will probably be among the most important tools you have available.

Finally, we are going to discuss **convective outlooks**. These are forecasts made by the SPC in the days before an event. 
They are categorical probabilities of an event happening within 25 miles (40km) of a point, and a meteorological 
synopsis of why that outlook is being issued. Convective outlooks are issued in three 'flavors' -- slight, moderate, 
and high risks. Each relates to a specific percentage probability. On the current day, the outlooks are made for wind, 
hail, and tornadoes instead of severe weather events as a whole.

These resources will be a great starting point is you are just learning to forecast, or a nice reference if you are 
more experienced. When chasers start really getting excited tends to line up with strongly worded convective outlooks, 
for obvious enough reasons.

Glossary of words used:

1. **Convection** - Meteorologists like to use this word as an analogue for thunderstorms. In discussions, convection 
is most likely being used in this way. Sometimes, you will see convection separated between shallow and deep. 
Cumulus (cu) towers tend to be associated with shallow convection, while deep convection is marked by cumulonimbus (cb).
2. **Convective Initiation** - The onset of deep convection. Generally, this means environmental inhibition to 
thunderstorm development has been overcome, and that a convective event is likely.
3. **Convective Outlooks** - 1-192 hour forecasts made by the storm prediction center that highlight severe weather 
possibilities categorically.
4. **Mesoscale Discussions** - Short time-limited discussions of a specific severe weather set up on the day of the 
event. Usually preceeds the issuance of a severe thunderstorm or tornado watch.
5. **Potentially Dangerous Situation** - A specific kind of watch reserved for the most violent severe weather set ups.
6. **Synoptic**, from *"seen at the same time"* - a branch of meteorology which deals with weather on large scales -- 
fronts, cyclones (low pressure areas) and jet streams. Events tend to be on the scale of thousands of kilometers and 
have a duration of weeks.
